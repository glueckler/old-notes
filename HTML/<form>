method attribute
---

GET (method="GET")
---
//when the <form> element method attribute is GET (or is ommited) the query string is tacked into the URL and the browser makes a GET request to that URL
//ex
GET /example/message.html?name=Jean&message=Yes%3F HTTP/1.1

-

POST (method="POST")
---
//when a POST request is specified the query string will be put in the body of the request
//rather than the URL
//ex
POST /example/message.html HTTP/1.1
Content-length: 24
Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

name=Jean&message=Yes%3F

-

query string
---
//the start is indicated by a question mark followed by a pair of name and values
? - (%3F) the start of the query string
& - seperates the different name/value pairs

-

escape characters
---
//URL encoding escapes characters with a % sign followed by 2 hexidecimal digits representing the unicode character code

//javascript provide encodeURIComponent and decodeURIComponent to manage URL encoding
//ex
console.log(encodeURIComponent("Hello & goodbye"));
// → Hello%20%26%20goodbye
console.log(decodeURIComponent("Hello%20%26%20goodbye"));
// → Hello & goodbye
