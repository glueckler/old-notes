Javascript Await
================

// The await operator is used to wait for a Promise. It can only be used inside an async function.

// The await expression causes async function execution to pause until a Promise is fulfilled or rejected, and to resume execution of the async function after fulfillment.

// When resumed, the value of the await expression is that of the fulfilled Promise.

// If the Promise is rejected, the await expression throws the rejected value.

// syntax
```javascript
[rv] = await expression;
```
expression // A Promise or any value to wait for.

rv // Returns the fulfilled value of the promise, or the value itself if it's not a Promise.

---

// ex, If a Promise is passed to an await expression, it waits for the Promise to be fulfilled and returns the fulfilled value
```javascript
function resolveAfter2Seconds(x) {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(x);
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function f1() {
  var x = await resolveAfter2Seconds(10);
  console.log(x); // 10
}
f1();
```

---

// ex, If the value is not a Promise, it converts the value to a resolved Promise, and waits for it.
```javascript
async function f2() {
  var y = await 20;
  console.log(y); // 20
}
f2();
```

---

// ex, If the Promise is rejected, the rejected value is thrown
```javascript
async function f3() {
  try {
    var z = await Promise.reject(30);
  } catch(e) {
    console.log(e); // 30
  }
}
f3();
```
